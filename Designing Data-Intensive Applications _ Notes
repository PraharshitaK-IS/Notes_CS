### Notes on 'Designing data intensive applications - Martin Kleppmann'

# Chapter 1
- reliability (tolerating hardware, software faults and human error)
- scalability (Measuring load and performance latency, percentile throughput)
- maintainability (operability, simplicity and evolvability)


" Applications need to:
• Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
• Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
• Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
• Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream processing)
• Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)"
